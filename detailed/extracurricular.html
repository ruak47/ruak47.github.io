        <p class="ActivityText">Beyond the realm of sports, my involvement in the debating society, media society, and business initiatives within my school has been particularly enriching. The idea for all 3 initial Socities was proposed by me and I, along with my core team, ran these socities. These experiences have fostered my communication skills, critical thinking abilities, and entrepreneurial mindset. I am proud to have extended the reach of these societies and business initiatives to the broader community, bringing a taste of intellectual discourse and entrepreneurial spirit to the town.</p>
